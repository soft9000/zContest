Your console application must be able to Create, Read, Update,
and Delete at least a single page entry. The use of multiple
entries is optional, but encouraged. The use of a hexadecimal,
octal, or other type(s) of encryption protocol(s) is optional.
The use of database technologies, such as PyDAO, is encouraged.

## zThing
In order to avoid government oversight, please note that heavier 
encryption strategies must include all encryption / decryption

encryption passwords, the use of removable devices to hold data is
encouraged.
