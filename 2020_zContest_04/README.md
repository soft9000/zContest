## zContest

This fourth contest is officially due on September 1st of this year.
Your mission - if you decide to accept it - is to create a Computer 
Game. 

Rather than limit your imagination, from creating simple 
word-guessing games, side-scrollers, roguelikes, dice rollers,
graphical shoot-em-ups, or pandemic simulators, we'll let 
YOU decide what type of game to create.

No matter what game's afoot however, we'll let our fellow 'Pythoneers, 
as officially registered on Facebook, decide which software developers 
created the best games. 

## zJudges
Volunteer judges can sign up @ https://www.facebook.com/groups/zcontest . 

An army over 10,000 strong, students interested in learning more about 
programing in Python 3 do so @ https://www.facebook.com/groups/Python3Training

## zContestants
Designed for 'Pythoneers of all descriptions, the purpose of zContest
