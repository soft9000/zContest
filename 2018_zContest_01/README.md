## zContest

Our first contest was designed to be a freestyle activity. 

Given 30 days to compete, the mission was to author a program
designed to create, read, update, and delete (C.R.U.D) a 
stand-alone software offering. Students were free to choose any 
collection theme.

Entitled "The C.R.U.D Contest," the prize winnings were valued
at $600.oo. The winnings consisted of a complete set of videos 
to a newly released training opportunity. 

## zPrizes
Known as “Graphical Python” the new set of videos were made 
publicly available on Udemy the same day that the winnings 
were awarded: September 1st, 2018.

## zContestants
Contestants were Python 3 students from our Pasco County 
and Tampa Florida Students.
